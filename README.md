# STUDENT RESULT CALCULATOR

## STUDENT INFORMATION
**Name:** Ajadi Ayomiposi Praise  
**Matric Number:** 24/13890  

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a simple Student Result Calculator developed using C++.  
The program collects a student's name, number of subjects, and subject scores, then calculates the total score, average score, and assigns a grade based on the average.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Manual calculation of student results can be time-consuming and prone to errors.  
This project aims to automate the process of calculating student results accurately using a computer program.


## AIM AND OBJECTIVES
### Aim:
To develop a simple program that calculates student results automatically.

### Objectives:
- To accept student details and scores
- To calculate total and average scores
- To determine student grade
- To display results clearly

## SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)

### 1. Planning
At this stage, the problem was identified and the need for an automated student result calculation system was established.

### 2. Requirement Analysis
The following requirements were identified:
- Input student name
- Input number of subjects
- Input scores for each subject
- Calculate total and average
- Assign grades using conditions


### 3. System Design
The program was designed using:
- Variables for storing data
- Loop for collecting scores
- Conditional statements for grading
- Console output for displaying results


### 4. Implementation
The system was implemented using the C++ programming language.  
Standard input and output functions were used to interact with the user.


### 5. Testing
The program was tested using different inputs to ensure:
- Correct calculation of total and average
- Correct grade assignment
- Proper display of results


### 6. Maintenance
The program can be improved in the future by:
- Adding input validation
- Saving results to a file
- Creating a graphical user interface
